<h3>LAGAAN</h3>
<p>This is my favourite and it gives me motivation to
    watch,here in this movie it describes the people of india 
    are under british rule,so the local villages(farmers) have to give tax to 
    the british government,so one day the british government decided to 
    double the tax ,so they held a cricket match in order to 
    leave the british rule.
